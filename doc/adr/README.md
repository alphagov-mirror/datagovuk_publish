# Architecture

## Architecture Decision Records

We will record design decisions for the architecture to ensure we preserve the context of our
choices. These will be written in the format proposed in a
[blog post by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)

### Tooling

We will use [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) to help manage the decisions.

`brew install adr-tools`

`adr new 'Decision to record'`

Please ensure that this tool is used at the **root** of the repository only.
